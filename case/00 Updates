11-2: v1 3D model designed in CAD. Essentially 1:1 recreation of original TRS-80

11-7: v2 3D Model. Keyboard plate designed and case adapted to mount keyboard. 
              will probably need to bottom mount keyboard in future versions.
              Should alleviate a lot of the board flex inherent with top mount.
