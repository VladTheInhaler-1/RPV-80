With the new Pi-5 coming out, and no news on a Pi 500 I wanted to design something that would provide a similar portable platform without sacrificing the functionality of the Pi. Instead of just designing a keyboard Pi case, I decided to design a "new" Model 100.

Right now I am just designing the shell at 1:1 scale of the Model 100. I will be resizing and adjusting as I continue to source components.

Current to-do list:

    -Source an ultrawide touch screen that will give maximum visibility without compromising aesthetics.

    -Design a 60% keyboard that fits the shell while still providing a modern key layout.

        -See if I can source any MX cherry Lock switches to keep that vintage feel on "lock" keys.

    -source and integrate I/O (USB, HDMI-out, GPIO, USB-C, SDR-aerial)

    -cooling path/hardware

    -on-board power

    -fold-in stand to give a better angle when sitting and typing.
